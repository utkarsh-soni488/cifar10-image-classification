# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with TensorFlow

This repository contains a project for small image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset with TensorFlow and Keras. We will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for this image classification problem.


## Introduction

In this project, we will perform image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset with TensorFlow and Keras. We will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into 10 different categories. The steps include downloading and loading the dataset, visualizing the data, and training the model.

## Features

- Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Visualize the dataset
- Build a CNN model using Keras
- Train the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Evaluate the model's performance
